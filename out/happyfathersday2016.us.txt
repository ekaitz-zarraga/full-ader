<br><small>Our extensive experience ensures you of the highest quality product. As in most industries, when they start to mature the low price competitors come in to make quick money with inferior products. The Vinyl Wall Decal industry has been no different. Just in the past few years, we have seen a flood of inferior products coming in from overseas. While these products are usually cheap, they aren’t usually even functional. These products come without necessities like pre-installed transfer tape making it almost impossible for you to actually install the product. One company we know of doesn’t even “weed” their products making them useless for most customers. Of course, trying to fight with a Chinese company for a $5 refund is seldom worth the time so most users just end up frustrated and disappointed. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&v=72PwGBYKKj4">Share Your Faith Products</a>

There were nets of network and twisted threads of chainwork for the capitals which were on the top of the pillars; seven for the one capital and seven for the other capital. So he made the pillars, and two rows around on the one network to cover the capitals which were on the top of the pomegranates; and so he did for the other capital. The capitals which were on the top of the pillars in the porch were of lily design, four cubits. There were capitals on the two pillars, even above and close to the rounded projection which was beside the network; and the pomegranates numbered two hundred in rows around both capitals. Thus he set up the pillars at the porch of the nave; and he set up the right pillar and named it Jachin, and he set up the left pillar and named it Boaz. On the top of the pillars was lily design.

<br><strong>To the choirmaster. A Psalm of David. O Lord, you have searched me and known me! You know when I sit down and when I rise up; you discern my thoughts from afar. You search out my path and my lying down and are acquainted with all my ways. Even before a word is on my tongue, behold, O Lord, you know it altogether. You hem me in, behind and before, and lay your hand upon me. ... <a href="https://m.youtube.com/v/72PwGBYKKj4">Share Your Faith Products</a>

<br><sup>Jacob lived in the land of his father's sojournings, in the land of Canaan. These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was pasturing the flock with his brothers. He was a boy with the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, his father's wives. And Joseph brought a bad report of them to their father. Now Israel loved Joseph more than any other of his sons, because he was the son of his old age. And he made him a robe of many colors. But when his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, they hated him and could not speak peacefully to him. Now Joseph had a dream, and when he told it to his brothers they hated him even more. ... <a href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/72PwGBYKKj4">Share Your Faith Products</a>

<br><sub>See what kind of love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of God; and so we are. The reason why the world does not know us is that it did not know him. Beloved, we are God's children now, and what we will be has not yet appeared; but we know that when he appears we shall be like him, because we shall see him as he is. And everyone who thus hopes in him purifies himself as he is pure. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PwGBYKKj4&hc_location=ufi">Bible Scripture Verse Crafts</a>

<br><strike>Beaten silver is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz. They are the work of the craftsman and of the hands of the goldsmith; their clothing is violet and purple; they are all the work of skilled men. But the Lord is the true God; he is the living God and the everlasting King. At his wrath the earth quakes, and the nations cannot endure his indignation. Thus shall you say to them: “The gods who did not make the heavens and the earth shall perish from the earth and from under the heavens.” <a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/72PwGBYKKj4&feature=youtu.be">Share Your Faith Products</a>

<br><blockquote>He made an altar of bronze, twenty cubits long and twenty cubits wide and ten cubits high. Then he made the sea of cast metal. It was round, ten cubits from brim to brim, and five cubits high, and a line of thirty cubits measured its circumference. Under it were figures of gourds, for ten cubits, compassing the sea all around. The gourds were in two rows, cast with it when it was cast. It stood on twelve oxen, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south, and three facing east. The sea was set on them, and all their rear parts were inward. Its thickness was a handbreadth. And its brim was made like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily. It held 3,000 baths. ... <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PwGBYKKj4&hc_location=ufi">Bible Verse Crafts</a>

<br><sup>"The house which I am about to build will be great, for greater is our God than all the gods. "But who is able to build a house for Him, for the heavens and the highest heavens cannot contain Him? So who am I, that I should build a house for Him, except to burn incense before Him? "Now send me a skilled man to work in gold, silver, brass and iron, and in purple, crimson and violet fabrics, and who knows how to make engravings, to work with the skilled men whom I have in Judah and Jerusalem, whom David my father provided. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/72PwGBYKKj4">Scripture Verse Crafts</a>
