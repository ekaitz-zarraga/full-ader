<br><sub>Home remodeling superstores carry a great selection of door hardware.  Choose knobs and pulls that complement your architectural style, and don’t cut corners. This is what I call a brooch – an added touch that makes the whole room work! Also, remove and replace any old painted-over hinges with shiny new ones. It is time consuming, but very inexpensive. And it makes a huge difference.
</sub>
<br><em>That’s where Hatfield Builders & Remodelers comes in. We’ll take that faded wallpaper and dated linoleum and transform your space into an elegant, functional room that you can truly enjoy. Outdated cabinets? Limited storage? No problem. Our kitchen design experts will work with you to create a one-of-a-kind space you and your family will love for years to come—your home, reimagined.

<br><pre>Silver is also a great choice but may not be the best idea if your kitchen has a lot of rough usages (think oily hands!) or if you wish to keep costs down. And should you go for knobs or handles? Again, you can choose one or both to give a slightly edgier look to your kitchen. The point here essentially is that while changing cabinets can cost a lot and involves a lot of efforts, the hardware is much easier to update and more affordable. And when the knobs look nice, even slightly old cabinets will look as good as new.
</pre>
<br><blockquote>You can begin planning for your kitchen remodel by knowing a rough estimate of where your money will be spent. For a full kitchen renovation, 1/3 of your budget will go to cabinetry, 1/3 will be spent on installation, and the remaining 1/3 is allocated to finishing touches. Finishing touches could be appliances, lighting, faucets, sinks, plumbing, backsplash, countertops, or flooring. Keeping these in mind, you’ll be able to balance your budget and more easily plan your project. For additional details on the cost of remodeling a kitchen, please visit our cost guide.
</blockquote>
<br><i>When it comes to flooring ideas, hardwood is the most well-known standard and material. Within hardwood, however, there are a lot of variations and differences. The most common form of hardwood flooring came in thick planks of solid timber. Solid hardwood is milled from a single piece of wood and hence a completely natural material. It is more adept at handling temperature and humidity changes.
</i>
<br><font>Oak and walnut are two of the most common hardwood choices and for good reason. Oak is durable and stains well while giving an appealing natural grain and is reasonably priced. Hickory, maple, ash, cherry are also good choices too so take your time and decide accordingly. If you prefer a light-colored hardwood floor, ash is an ideal option, while people who expect a lot of foot traffic should consider hickory as an option.
</font>
<br><strike>But of course, a kitchen makeover is much more than that. Not only does it seek to reinvigorate the space most dear to the house, but it also will go a long way in ensuring that a fresh, updated kitchen remains at the heart of a healthy family. Let us understand what exactly you need to change and how you can manage a complete kitchen makeover. Wondering how much will your kitchen remodel cost? Check out our complete guide in budgeting your kitchen renovation.

<br><sup>The matte finish of this durable stone adds an ultra-modern touch to the kitchen without the excessive reflections. In a way, it makes it less susceptible to smudging too. Besides the evergreen black, brown and beiges, the finish also allows you to opt for exotic red and blue colors should you want to add a bit of color to your kitchen. Contrast the seams and colors of the slab with the plainness of white oak cabinets to add an unrivaled touch of class. You can’t go wrong with a pop of color set to a plain white setting. As oak is equally gracious when paired with granite and relatively less prone to water damage than MDFs, the pairing is bound to be a hit. The number of kitchen countertop ideas is as many as the types of countertops, be it natural stones like granite and marble (wondering the difference between granite and marble?) or other engineered stones like quartz.
</sup>
<br><sub>The best part about it is that there are so many ways to play around with it and be creative. You could go for white open shelving to highlight the wallpaper or the paint in or you could even mix and match it with the cabinetry. No need to get rid of cabinetry entirely — just add shelves between windows or in the corners of the kitchen to display your most prized cookbooks, pottery or teacups. Customize it with hooks to hang stuff or opt for fancy boxes and baskets to add a touch of sophistication. Undercabinetry lights are highly recommended for kitchens looking to add a bit of x-factor. We suggest opting for only one color of glassware to display on these open shelves for the best effect. There a lot of kitchen open shelves ideas that can overhaul the look of your kitchen as well as add an astonishing functionality.

<br><sub>If they’re quality wood and still in good working order, you’re in luck. This is one of the first things I check when sizing up a pre-remodel kitchen, since cabinet frames are the most expensive component of the entire space.  It’s quite simple to give salvageable cabinets a face lift. Three common ways to repurpose and save thousands include: adding new doors and drawer fronts, re-laminating fronts and sides, or repainting – which leads us to......Don’t Just Paint – Spray Paint. Have all the cabinets cleaned and lightly sanded, then have a painter come in to spray them. Don’t try to DIY this one; a couple of cans of spray paint from the hardware store just won’t do the trick. A professional spray job can make ugly cabinets look factory-new. And you can’t get the same look by painting or rolling the cabinets yourself.
</sub>
<br><font>When buying new fridges, ranges, and dishwashers, stick with the same brand. Fortunately appliance manufactures have begun to create good-looking, low-priced lines that include matching sets. With a little research and some smart shopping, you can find affordable appliances that look very high-end – and when they all match, you get a designer look for much less.</font>
<br><font>After our initial consultation we got to go to the Kitchen Mart showroom and actually see what our finished kitchen will look like. That was the kicker for me – I’m a very visual person. Just seeing something written, or even sketched, makes it hard for me to visualize the finished product. I got to see what my kitchen is going to look like, and I fell in love instantly.
</font>
<br><font>Revitalizing and renovating a kitchen can be a tricky affair: not only do you have to decide what you must change, but you must also decide where to best spend your money. And dollar for dollar, new cabinet doors are one of the best investments. The reasons are simple: every day, your cabinet doors are opened a number of times and over a period, they suffer wear and tear. Even if the doors may not ‘look’ old, the hinges, for example, tend to get loose.
</font>
<br><b>Think about how you can function without a working kitchen. Utilize small appliances and keep your pantry stocked with nonperishable grab-and-go items. Use biodegradable plates, cups, and utensils since you won’t have a working dishwasher. Take advantage of a grill or outdoor cooking area if you have one. You may also want to consider eating out with family or friends more often. Being prepared ahead of time will greatly alleviate any stress you may have without a functioning kitchen during the remodel.
