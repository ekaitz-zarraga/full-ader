<br><u>The Home Depot is a great place to buy your kitchen appliances and remodeling materials. We also provide top-rated design and installation services for homeowners across America. Besides undergoing full background checks, our hand-selected remodeling experts are local, licensed and insured. The Home Depot also offers a great selection of flexible finance options.
</u>
<br><em>If the kitchen is the heart of the home, then the countertops might be called the heart of the kitchen. Therefore, as you can tell above, it’s one of the most popular kitchen remodeling projects. The average cost of having new countertops installed is $3,401, but it's important to realize how much this can vary from project to project. The price will depend on the size of your kitchen, the simplicity of the layout and the materials used.
</em>
<br><strike>If you’re thinking about updating appliances or adding new ones, a kitchen remodel is the perfect time to do so, as your cabinet design will be built around your appliance specs. New appliances can give your kitchen a fresh look, but it’s important to choose the right appliances for your needs. If you don’t spend a lot of time in the kitchen, standard appliances might be sufficient. If you enjoy cooking, baking and entertaining, top-of-the-line appliances may be essential. <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9HhigxwRChw" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</strike>
<br><em>If you plan to remain in your house for years, then you should consider splurging on items like new countertops, appliances, cabinets and flooring. The fact you'll be living in the house for years to come means that you could save money on repair or replacement because they last longer. It also means that you continue to find value in their repeated use. If you plan to live in your house for years or decades after the renovation, there's no point in spending money and only making small changes.
</em>
<br><small>After our initial consultation we got to go to the Kitchen Mart showroom and actually see what our finished kitchen will look like. That was the kicker for me – I’m a very visual person. Just seeing something written, or even sketched, makes it hard for me to visualize the finished product. I got to see what my kitchen is going to look like, and I fell in love instantly.
</small>
<br><u>Keep in mind, however, that some personal loan companies let you borrow only up to $35,000 or $40,000, which means you may need to consider another option if your borrowing needs are greater. Also note that while personal loans can offer fixed interest rates as low as 4 percent, the best rates and terms tend to go to borrowers with good or excellent credit.
</u>
<br><b>For those looking to remodel their kitchen within a tight budget there are several options including using an inexpensive countertop material like butcher block, refacing existing cabinets, adding new paint to existing cabinets, replacing existing floors with a laminate or other affordable material. And a fresh paint job can do wonders to refresh a kitchen. Using particleboard instead of plywood where it won’t be seen, doing the demolition of the kitchen yourself and other money-savers can help you get the kitchen of your dreams but without going into debt to do it.
</b>
<br><h5>Older homes typically don’t have enough amps to handle modern demand. Any new work will need to be wired with a new meter, paneling and piping, which can cost $1,000+ to bring it up from the older 60 amps to the modern 200 amps or more. If you move appliances to other parts of the kitchen or install new lighting anywhere no lights have been before, this cost will be factored in. You’ll probably also need new outlets at an average price of $150.
</h5>
<br><sub>Additionally, personal taste will increase or decrease the total cost of your kitchen remodel.  Some of us have expensive taste while others are content with inexpensive solutions such as laminate counters or plain white walls. Furthermore, as time moves on, more and more homeowners are opting for modern touches, which of course come with a higher price tag. Traditional kitchens are still very popular, but they also tend to be less expensive than modern designs. Needless to say, whether it’s the counters, appliances, dishwasher or cabinets, your personal taste will alter your kitchen renovation cost.

<br><u>Although the following figures are for each project done separately, you’ll likely be able to save on each project when completed as part of a total kitchen remodel. However, these amounts will give you an idea of how much money each specific area of the kitchen will require. Then, you can add items together that you want completed to come up with a budget objective.
</u>
<br><sup>Then there's the cost of flooring, which is between $1,400 to $5,000 and highly dependent on the material selected and the overall square footage. While vinyl is an excellent option in terms of affordability, it does not add much value to a home. In comparison, granite and hardwood flooring will increase value, but at a higher cost. While wood floors are popular, most remodelers don’t recommend having them in your kitchen because they are so susceptible to moisture.
</sup>
<br><b>If you do have the budget to rearrange appliances, make sure to keep your floor plan in mind. Does it follow the natural triangular traffic pattern between the refrigerator, stove, and oven? Is the dishwasher next to the sink? It should be, because otherwise, you create a mess every time you walk across the room with a dripping dish in your hand. To save money, I once put a dishwasher in the counter opposite the sink – and as a result, I cleaned up drips on the floor for years.
</b>
<br><u>Hardware Updates: Hardware is often referred to as the jewelry of the cabinetry. Luckily, certain styles and types of hardware are cheap, but can still transform the look and feel of any kitchen. Just know that a typical kitchen can have anywhere between 20-40 knobs and pulls. Remember, the cheaper items will not last as long as the more expensive purchases.
</u>
<br><u>The average cost of kitchen fixtures, appliances, and labor differs by U.S. region. Remodeling projects in the Southern United States are generally cheaper than identical projects completed in Northern and Western areas. For instance, a major kitchen overhaul with midrange materials could cost $56,639 in Titusville, FL and rise to $77,460 if completed in San Francisco, CA. 
</u>
<br><blockquote>Consider narrower cabinets, because most people don’t use the space at the back of cabinets, you can get cabinets that aren’t as deep but are better designed for full access—with pull-out baskets, spice drawers, sectioned drawers, corner cabinet carousels, etc. Fill an extra space with narrow filler cabinets with sliders. Consider reducing a double sink to a single for more workspace as well.
</blockquote>
<br><em>In a well-designed kitchen, lighting serves various functions. For example, an overhead fixture brightens up the overall space, while sconces illuminate specific tasks. "For kitchens, there’s definitely been an uptick in pendants for use over islands," says Ashley Fothergill, creative director at Mitzi and Hudson Valley Lighting. "Sconces are in demand, too, for lighting the washing of dishes in the sink or as an accent along a backsplash behind the stove."
</em>
<br><font>Think about how you can function without a working kitchen. Utilize small appliances and keep your pantry stocked with nonperishable grab-and-go items. Use biodegradable plates, cups, and utensils since you won’t have a working dishwasher. Take advantage of a grill or outdoor cooking area if you have one. You may also want to consider eating out with family or friends more often. Being prepared ahead of time will greatly alleviate any stress you may have without a functioning kitchen during the remodel.
</font>
<br><i>When remodeling a kitchen, most homeowners begin with their kitchen cabinets. After all, cabinets significantly impact the kitchen's overall first impression. Those that are dated or damaged can leave future buyers underwhelmed, even if the kitchen has immense potential. On average, you can expect to pay between $3,000–$8,000, depending on whether or not you choose custom cabinets.
</i>
<br><font>After you and one of our kitchen designers have selected from all the great products our stores have to offer, don’t forget: The Home Depot’s high-quality contractors can do it for you!
