<br><small>More often than not, we keep food cold until it comes time to cook. In order to make that famous lasagna or spaghetti and meatballs, you need a reliable oven/stove combo. Like many other kitchen appliances, the oven and stove have come a long way. While stainless steel is undoubtedly preferred materials nowadays, appliance manufacturers are creating updated versions every single day.
</small>
<br><h4>New appliances have an impact on both the appearance and functionality of the kitchen. Growing families may need to invest in larger refrigerators and stoves while empty nesters are often looking to simplify and downgrade. Choosing Energy Star-rated appliances conserves energy and reduces the cost of future electric bills. However, the initial installation of an appliance averages $512 and may be more depending on location. Some appliance retailers include installation in the purchase price. Homeowners looking to save money on kitchen renovations should always shop around for the best price. Never get one estimate or go to one source.
</h4>
<br><small>The price of new countertops differs widely based on materials. Stone surfaces, like quartz and granite, are the most durable, but also the most expensive. Solid surface and laminate are less costly but require more maintenance. Ceramic tiles are generally an affordable backsplash alternative, depending on their brand and the complexity of the tiling layout.
</small>
<br><font>If this seems expensive, maybe you can get the people to work at times when you are not at home. If you must move, how about calling old friends you haven’t met in a long time and visiting them? Make it sound like you missed them, and bunk on their couch if needed. This might sound a little cheap, and it sure is. It is cheaper than staying in a motel, for example. And if you save some money, invite them over for a good meal in your ‘new’ kitchen.
</font>
<br><blockquote>While cabinets may be the most expensive kitchen item, many homeowners agree that your countertops are the heart of the kitchen. Your kitchen counters can make or break your entire kitchen design. That is why you must decide on layout and composition before considering installation. Homeowners must decide if you want a prep area, kitchen island or both. Bear in mind, too little counter space makes it difficult to share the kitchen with family members and coordinate meals.
</blockquote>
<br><pre>Energy Star-rated Appliances – Are certified as energy-efficient. Although they often cost more upfront, homeowners benefit from lower utility bills, longer lifespans, and many states offer residential rebates and incentives to help make your home more resourceful. Look for this certification when purchasing your dishwasher, freezer, fridge, and even lights. Average cost: $300 to $3,000. <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MFaGA6okhIE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
