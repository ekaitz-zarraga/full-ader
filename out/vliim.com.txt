<br><sub>According to Remodeling Magazine’s 2019 Cost Vs. Value report an upscale bathroom remodel can cost, on national average, $64,743. That type of upscale remodel would generally expand the existing bath footprint by more than 50 percent and include details such as in-floor heating, high-end faucet, a shower body-spray fixture, a frameless glass enclosure, a freestanding soaking tub, stone countertops and two sinks, two mirrored medicine cabinets with lighting, a separate commode area and a humidity-controlling exhaust fan, general and spot lighting and wall cabinets.

<br><pre>Once your new materials have arrived, the tearout begins. This involves removing everything from your bathroom right down to the studs. At this point in time, if there are issues with water leaks or mold, they can be addressed. It is at this stage that hidden issues are usually uncovered. Keep in mind that issues can dramatically impact your costs, depending on what is found. For example, mold remediation starts at $500 and water damage can cost as much as $2,700.
</pre>
<br><tt>Please keep in mind that Bay Cities Construction is a Licensed General contractor located in California. Construction costs in Los Angeles, California are much higher than other parts of the country. Our office is in Torrance, CA which is within Los Angeles County. Construction prices in Los Angeles, reflect that fact. I would say that all of California’s regulation and higher cost of living, inflates prices by 30%-40% in comparison to the mid-west. My gripes about the cost of doing business is better served in a rant video elsewhere.

<br><strong>The first question everyone wants to know is “how much will it cost to remodel my bathroom?” My name is Alexander Rodriguez, MBA I am the founder and owner of Bay Cities Construction, a Licensed General Contractor in Torrance, CA. This article is part of a series of articles that explains the various dimensions of pricing out a  bathroom remodeling project. I don’t like so shy away from talking about money, I want my customers to understand how and why things cost what the cost. I wrote an article and filmed a video that goes into detail about how costs are allocated, you can follow this link to see that content. I also recommend reading, “4 things that increase the cost of a bathroom remodel.” Hit the link to read that article and video. Armed with this information you should be ready to make a wiser decision about your project.

<br><h3>Choose the main color theme for your bathroom, but it should depend on the existing color of the wall. For example, for white colors, apply the white color on all over the walls and furniture. But to keep the contrast, apply a bit darker color for your flooring. You can do it by having a cheaper tile stamp to get the floral or another exciting pattern.
</h3>
<br><u>Some of the new trends in master bath remodels, according to the NKBA’s 2019 Trend Report, include in-floor heating, app-enabled controls for radiant floors and digital shower valves, floating cabinetry, high-gloss and textured melamine looks, wet rooms with tubs and showers in the same room and a drain in floor and black frames as shower focal points. Transitional-style master bathrooms are currently the most popular bath style at 59% of bathroom remodels, says NKBA, with traditional baths a close second.
</u>
<br><sub>You want a company that has time for you and has long-term relationships with its subcontractors. Make sure you and your contractor have the same expectations about how often they will be onsite once the remodel or renovation kicks off. The contractor should be open with you about how long each stage of the project will take, and they should show a good understanding of what factors could potentially push that timeline out.

<br><em>The cost to remodel a bathroom varies greatly. Factors like the current state of the space, the specific bathroom remodel design plans and material costs can all impact the overall price. Some bathroom remodel projects involve simple repairs and replacements in a small bathroom, whereas others require major replacements and upgrades, renovation of an entire bathroom or the addition of a whole new bathroom. So what will a bathroom remodeling contractor charge you? Let's look at the numbers.
</em>
<br><tt>When you use a bold accessory like an animal skin, you need to make sure that it isn't lost in a bunch of other decor elements. This bathroom uses its neutral, modern design to really give space to the zebra skin rug here. And the great thing about this kind of design is that you can change this one decor element as often as you wish, without having to spend thousands remodeling every time.
</tt>
<br><em>It's becoming increasingly popular to purchase custom items for the home, including the bathroom. While not everything can be made to order, custom cabinetry can help you make the most of the space. This type of work can typically cost significantly more than readymade and can take approximately 12 weeks to complete. Carpenters typically charge at least $70 an hour for built-ins 7, while can raise the cost of things like cabinetry to $2,000 per cabinet, with many bathrooms using a minimum of 3 or more.
</em>
<br><u>Choose the main color theme for your bathroom, but it should depend on the existing color of the wall. For example, for white colors, apply the white color on all over the walls and furniture. But to keep the contrast, apply a bit darker color for your flooring. You can do it by having a cheaper tile stamp to get the floral or another exciting pattern.
</u>
<br><h1>Bathrooms traditionally have few to no natural lighting sources, so any lights that you include are important to the function of the room. Lighting helps not only with the use of the bathroom, but specific task lighting in the vanity and shower areas help enhance your experience there. Lighting for the bathroom can take several forms. The most common include:
</h1>
<br><font>And industry trends bear out this desire for bigger, or just better, master baths. According to the National Kitchen and Bath Association (NKBA) homeowners undertaking bathroom renovations are spending the most on master bathrooms with an average budget of $32,000 (including materials and labor). That’s more than twice what is spent on a powder room remodel. That average cost, however, is dependent upon a host of factors including the scope of the remodel, whether you are using luxury or standard fixtures, where you live and other considerations. <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZeewhIe2fns" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
