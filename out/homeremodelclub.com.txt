<br><pre>Kitchen cabinet installation costs an average of $2,000 to $8,000, with the products themselves ranging from $75 to $1,500 per linear foot.Kitchen cabinets prices vary depending on whether you opt for custom or stock products, and your project price will also depend on whether you update them rather than replace them. These features often make a room's first impression. If they are dated or damaged, potential buyers may walk away underwhelmed.

<br><strike>Contractor: instead of hiring a designer to oversee the project, you could instead go with a general contractor who has experience remodeling kitchens. Contractors will oversee the whole project, and they often work closely with a team of electricians, plumbers, and carpenters. Contractors often charge as a percentage of the total of the remodel cost, similar to a kitchen designer. Think of your contractor as your remodeling manager. Contractors often charge 10-20% of the total project cost. <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f_vk786paE4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<br><sub>The kitchen work triangle is the area where most tasks are performed in your kitchen. This usually involves the refrigerator, the stove, and the sink. The spacing of these items is essential, as you’ll spend a lot of time moving back and forth between these three focal points. Our kitchen designers will help you find the optimal location for your work triangle. We will design your kitchen to be functional to fit your specific needs.
</sub>
<br><b>Professional kitchen designers charge $100 to $200 per hour. Though the NKBA suggests four percent of your budget will go to design fees, this shoots up to closer to 10 percent when you hire a certified professional on-site. If you get advice or an in-home consultation from a materials and design store, it will certainly stay in the range of a $100 to $800 flat fee. However, homeowners report paying $3,500 to $18,500 for certified professionals and independent services. At this rate, you might expect such services as:

<br><strong>There's a lot to love about this kitchen designed by Arent & Pyke, but we're particularly impressed by the careful, asymmetrical balance happening here. The hood leans to the right of the room, as do the bar stools, which is subtlety reflected in the cream lumbar pillow camouflaging into the sofa. Meanwhile, the linear floating shelf in line with the hood as well as the light fixture, island counter, and sofa form a soothing sense of symmetry.
</strong>
<br><font>Chandeliers and pendants: these are particularly popular in areas with high ceilings. Pendants and chandeliers also allow you to add some color or personality to your kitchen. This type of lighting fixture can provide either ambient or task lighting. Pendant lamps range from $30-$300 each. Chandeliers range in price from $50-$5,000 depending on size and material.

<br><strong>Be Smart About Countertops: Selecting and purchasing new countertops is a big project, but there are ways to simplify the process. If you want new counters, but are worried about how much they cost, then consider materials that look nice but don’t come with a high price tag. Installing ceramic tile is a great choice for a budget-friendly kitchen countertop.

<br><blockquote>A great way to update your kitchen doesn’t have to involve hefty tools or paint brushes. Sometimes, all a kitchen may need is a thorough deep clean to look like new. Think beyond the dirty dishes. Are there areas of your kitchen that you tend to neglect? It’s a good idea to give your kitchen a deep clean at least twice a year. Here are some areas you may want to consider:
</blockquote>
<br><blockquote>Similarly, you can update your kitchen by changing the color of your cabinets. You don’t need a complete remodel to update the look. You can paint your cabinets and make them look like new again! While you can likely complete the painting in an afternoon, it may take a day or two to dry completely. Remember this as you’re planning your paint project. See our tutorial on the Best Way To Paint Kitchen Cabinets. 
</blockquote>
<br><strong>Neighborhood: Location, location, location. You hear it in real estate all the time. That’s because location matters and you have to consider your neighborhood and street before any kitchen remodel. Unless you plan on living in your Dallas home for the next 30 years, try to determine what neighbors are spending on their kitchen remodels. If you need to sell your home one day, your kitchen shouldn’t be the most extravagant kitchen on the block. If it is, homeowners may pass due to the increased price tag.
