<br><h1>There are so many beautiful things to notice about this bathroom that it's hard to know where to start. The concrete sink? The wallpaper? The sconce lighting? The tarnished mirror on the door, reflected in the main mirror? The barely-there ultra-modern faucets? Whatever you notice first, though, you can't but admit that this space is a masterpiece.
</h1>

<br><h4>Nail the bottom plate to the floor and the top plate to the ceiling. Then mark the positions of the shower base, toilet and sink. Lay out and toenail the wall studs into position (Fig. B) and the top plate for the low wall. On the opposite end of the shower, frame a matching 35-in. wide wall (see Photo 14) 60-1/4 in. (or the length of your shower base plus 1/4 in.) away from the first wall.
</h4>
<br><tt>The key to a weatherproof, attractive glass block window both inside and out is to encase it in a custom-built wooden frame (Fig. A) with inside dimensions that are 1/2 in. taller and wider than the panel itself. That will give you room to adjust and shim the panel exactly and then inject expanding foam between the frame and the panel to lock it into the opening (Photos 3 and 4).
</tt>
<br><em>The wall-hung toilet’s supply line must have a male adapter with a temporary galvanized cap. Check the instructions on the toilet to get the proper location. Routing water supply lines is different in every bathroom, so you’ll have to adapt runs to your situation. But run the plastic drain lines and vents before starting any supply work. It’s much easier to route water supply lines around drain lines than to route drains and vents around supply lines. The same thinking applies to electrical work: Wait until the water supply work is finished before wiring.
</em>
<br><h1>This modern bathroom is perfect for an in-city loft or contemporary home. The concrete flooring and exposed wooden ceiling provide amazing textures to this simplistic bathroom. These simple elements are mimicked in the designs of the tub and sink, making the space look larger with a cohesive design. Linens on the sink, rug, and shower curtain bring a touch of softness to this industrial design.
</h1>
<br><h1>To begin, rip the top and side jambs to the thickness of the wall framing plus the exterior wall sheathing. The cement board will lap over the jambs. The windowsill should also be flush with the interior framing, but hang over the outside sheathing about 1-1/2 in. and have a 5-degree slope toward the outside to help shed water. To keep water from running behind the siding as it drips off the edge, cut a shallow groove (or saw kerf) in the bottom lip (Fig. A). Also, remember to flash behind the trim to keep the window watertight. Trim the window exterior to match the house, using caulk to seal between the trim and siding.

<br><pre>Who says wallpaper is dead? Far from looking dates, this woodlands themed wallpaper adds lines to this bathroom that draws attention to its height, and makes the room seem larger. The simple, geometric sink and clean, white backsplash prevent the wallpaper from making the room look cluttered. The nature theme is continued in the wood flooring and the artwork accents.

</u>
<br><font>Turn off the main water supply to the house, and in a convenient location, cut the hot and cold water supply pipes for the bathroom. Also cut out and remove all the existing water lines and fittings in the bathroom. Finally, cut out and remove the vent section leading to the sink and the main stack 5 in. below the vent tee. Stuff rags into open drain lines to keep sewer gas out of the house.
</font>
<br><blockquote>Using the ultra-trendy animal skull as a main focus point, this space definitely stands out from the rest of the usual white and boring contemporary bathrooms. Notice how the tiny, delicate bare branch echoes and contrasts the strong antlers on the wall, and how the pendant light hangs right in the middle of the negative space provided by the antlers.
</blockquote>
<br><i>These are some really great tips for anyone looking into remodeling or rejuvenating their bathroom. I have had the hardest time finding good storage options for my small downstairs bathroom, but that standing shelf unit actually looks really nice, I may have to try to find one like it. Thanks so much for writing, I’ll be referring back to this as I move along with my design.
</i>
<br><blockquote>As you begin your search for small bathroom design ideas, it might seem that decorators only cater to those with the expansive bathrooms normally featured in decor magazines and home renovation television shows. Don’t be disheartened! If your bathroom is barely big enough to accommodate one petite person, rest assured that you’re not alone. Design divas all over the internet have tackled the problem of cramped bathroom quarters.

<br><i>A DIY bathroom remodel is a big project. If you can only work weekends, your bathroom will be out of commission for two months or more. You’ll need all your expertise as an experienced do-it-yourselfer because you’ll have to tackle electrical, plumbing, tiling, drywalling, taping and even exterior siding. In this DIY shower remodel article, we’ll deal mostly with the nuts and bolts of ripping out existing plumbing and replacing it correctly with new, easily installed PVC piping.
</i>
<br><em>Step into the luxury of a 4-star hotel with this bathroom design. Marble tiling in the tub brings culture into the small space. The marble tile floor follows the pattern of the tub and provides a consistency to the room in a striking way. The deep soaking tub features a rain shower and a hand-held faucet feature, which adds a touch of luxury to your daily routine.The open towel storage solution will let you showcase your fluffiest towels, and remind you of your last stay in a luxury hotel.
</em>
<br><b>This gorgeous design brings the peace and tranquility of the spa into your home bathroom. Cedar wrapped ceilings and walls bring warmth and the healing properties of nature. The simplistic, neat lines provide unity to the room and inspire calming thoughts. The high window and white tiles in the shower afford lots of light to the room and add another touch of nature.

<br><em>To begin, rip the top and side jambs to the thickness of the wall framing plus the exterior wall sheathing. The cement board will lap over the jambs. The windowsill should also be flush with the interior framing, but hang over the outside sheathing about 1-1/2 in. and have a 5-degree slope toward the outside to help shed water. To keep water from running behind the siding as it drips off the edge, cut a shallow groove (or saw kerf) in the bottom lip (Fig. A).

<br><sup>Glass block comes in 8-in. and 6-in. squares and 4 x 8-in. half-block rectangles. You’ll need to choose between real mortar grout joints and clear silicone–joined blocks. We chose the silicone system because we liked the clean, uninterrupted look. Whichever way you go, buy the panel preassembled and banded together as one unit, ready to set into the opening.
</sup>
<br><sub>Don’t want your budget to skyrocket? Don't move your plumbing. On the surface, switching your sink and toilet around may look easy enough, but the problem lies underneath and all the costs involved in moving that plumbing. Besides, if you spend less money on moving fixtures, you’ll have more to spend on that new sleek shower system or vanity you’ve been eyeing. <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G3eeW_CJFA0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
