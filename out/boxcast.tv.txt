#
# Some publishers may choose to not authorize any advertising system by publishing an empty
# ads.txt file, indicating that no advertising system is authorized to buy and sell ads on the
# website. So that consuming systems properly read and interpret the empty file (differentiating
# between web servers returning error pages for the /ads.txt URL), at least one properly formatted
# line must be included which adheres to the format specification described above. For files that
# do not otherwise contain authorized advertising system records, use the following "placeholder"
# record to indicate that the file adheres to the ads.txt specification:
#
placeholder.example.com, placeholder, DIRECT, placeholder
