<br><pre>When estimating the cost of a kitchen remodel, there are various factors to keep in mind. The most important include budget, longevity, and what other homeowners in the neighborhood are doing with their spaces. By planning around these factors, it's possible to come out with results that meet expectations, last for a long time and recoup most of their original cost in the resale. <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-aH2rOklBvs" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<br><pre>As you increase the size of your project in regards to the square footage, you can expect to pay more. For example, a medium-sized space is typically defined as an area that is between 75 and 100+ square feet, costing between $15,000 and $30,000. For 12' x 12' kitchens between 150 and 175 square feet, which is around the average size, renovations range from $20,000 to $45,000.

<br><i>Major remodels involve a larger overhaul of the existing kitchen than minor remodels. Key fixtures—lighting, appliances and flooring—are replaced with new versions, while extra touches are added such as a high-end sink with matching faucet and semi-custom cabinetry. Semi-custom cabinets are customizable, with versatile sizing and door front options.

</strong>
<br><u>Minor remodels aim to preserve the kitchen’s existing footprint while refreshing its overall appearance and usability. The significant changes are usually budget-friendly fixes like painting the walls, adding new flooring and buying energy-efficient appliances, since the customer isn’t selecting top-of-the-line materials or products. Cabinetry is often a lofty expense, but minor remodels opt for money-saving measures like refacing the existing cabinets or selecting entry-level cabinets, which are mass-produced and ready-to-install.
</u>
<br><em>Building a budget should be your number one concern when planning a kitchen remodel. It determines how much you can accomplish, the materials available, how much professional help you’ll need, and what the final product will look like, among other aspects. If you don't plan appropriately, there's a good chance that you will find yourself in debt by the end of the project or left with a half-finished space after the funds run out.
</em>
<br><sup>Maintaining your existing plumbing is an excellent way to reduce costs. You can still invest in new appliances, sinks and faucets as long as you install them in the current plumbing positions. If your remodeling design requires the installation of new pipes or you're changing your kitchen's floor plan, be prepared to pay a plumber for labor and the necessary plumbing parts.
</sup>
<br><strong>While we pay a lot of attention to the paint we use in the house, the kitchen often tends to get ignored. Also, while the rest of the house may not need a repaint anytime soon, the walls of the kitchen undergo a lot of abuse. Smoke, water, oil and the general traffic in the kitchen can begin to reflect on its walls very soon. When painting a kitchen, remember that you should give attention to how the new color will gel with the rest of the house and whether the texture you pick will withstand oil and heat. Unless you wish to get an extremely fine and detailed painting done to the house, going DIY will make it even more affordable and a great way to get your family and friends involved. This also ensures that you have complete control over the designs so get creative!
</strong>
<br><sub>But of course, a kitchen makeover is much more than that. Not only does it seek to reinvigorate the space most dear to the house, but it also will go a long way in ensuring that a fresh, updated kitchen remains at the heart of a healthy family. Let us understand what exactly you need to change and how you can manage a complete kitchen makeover. Wondering how much will your kitchen remodel cost? Check out our complete guide in budgeting your kitchen renovation.

<br><u>Before you apply for a loan, price out every component of your kitchen remodel cost including materials and labor. If you’re working with a contractor, they may take care of this task on your behalf. Keep in mind that you may also want to factor in another 10 percent in costs for any construction overages, new kitchen decor or any related expenses that pop up.
</u>
<br><em>Gone are the days when the sight of your cutlery in the open would invite a frown from the visiting guests — in fact, more and more people are opening up to the idea of open shelving. If you are looking to contrast your new kitchen from the old one (or your grandma’s) and add a sense of ‘largeness’ to your space, you should definitely try open shelving.
</em>
<br><sup>Installing kitchen appliances costs $100 to $300 per appliance on average. Investing in higher quality stoves, dishwashers or refrigerators will certainly drive up your total price. However, if you want to improve your home’s value, it will pay to install higher quality products. There are various options to choose from, including EnergyStar-certified, custom built-in, high-end store bought and budget outlet products. If longevity is important to you, look for products with longer life expectancies.
</sup>
<br><pre>While the material you chose will, of course, depend on your personal needs, preferences, and budget, you can always save costs by doing it yourself instead of hiring a professional. The Internet has many videos on going the DIY route but remember, do it only if you have prior experience of knocking down existing design and relating a new design. DIY is good only for people who know their stuff; for others, it can turn out to be extremely time consuming and worse, a half-baked project.

<br><pre>Personal loans tend to be a good option for kitchen remodeling projects because you may have a good idea how much cash you need before you start demolition. This is especially true if you’re using a contractor for your kitchen renovation. Once they assess your project and draw up a proposal, you can use that information to compare loan options for the amount of capital you need. <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3SXPrrNJ7Oo" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
