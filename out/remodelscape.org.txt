<br><blockquote>If you want more counter and storage space, then adding a center island may be worth the cost. But an island can limit the number of people working in the kitchen, reduce traffic flow to one-way with no passing, and make for cramped quarters. Try out an island before committing to one. Slap together a full-scale model out of cardboard or plywood and live with it for a few days. Make sure you can open your stove and refrigerator doors. No space for an island? Consider a kitchen trolley instead.
</blockquote>
<br><em>In general, remember the latest appliances are not only more efficient, but they are also more ‘beautiful’ to look at. That said, do not prioritize form over function. Remember, appliances are long-term investments. If you are planning to sell the property, check with local property agents to confirm whether investing in new appliances will fetch you a higher price for the property. Of course, if you plan to continue staying at the house, then the investments made in appliances will improve the kitchen’s efficiency and performance.
</em>
<br><sub>If you’re thinking about updating appliances or adding new ones, a kitchen remodel is the perfect time to do so, as your cabinet design will be built around your appliance specs. New appliances can give your kitchen a fresh look, but it’s important to choose the right appliances for your needs. If you don’t spend a lot of time in the kitchen, standard appliances might be sufficient. If you enjoy cooking, baking and entertaining, top-of-the-line appliances may be essential.
</sub>
<br><b>Take advantage of unused areas in your kitchen. Toe-kick storage located beneath cabinet doors, for example, is a creative place to store items that aren't used on a daily basis, like serveware, linens, or a spare step ladder. Maximizing your kitchen's floor plan to find additional storage opportunities will also help keep your countertops free of clutter.

<br><u>They had great suggestions about designing a kitchen for kids, what appliances I should buy based on my cooking level, and how to furnish and organize everything once the kitchen was complete. I never want to move now that we have a fabulous, beautiful kitchen, but, if we are ever in the market for this service again, they are the only company I would use. You pay for what you get with them and KDC delivers an elite service on every level.

<br><sub>A temporary kitchen lets you cook, wash dishes and make your morning coffee while your main kitchen is out of commission. Save a few of your old cabinets and countertops to build the makeshift kitchen. You don’t need a fancy setup —functionality is the goal here. Install the cabinets and cut the countertop to fit, if necessary. Then add the items you need for preparing meals, like a toaster oven, hot plate, microwave, coffeemaker and refrigerator (even a half-size model would be great).

<br><h5>Optimize your kitchen floor plan for food prep and entertaining by rethinking the layout. Simply switching the location of your refrigerator, cabinets, and dishwasher could increase counter space and allow for a better traffic flow through the room. Kristin Jackson, the blogging virtuoso behind The Hunted Interior, significantly augmented her kitchen storage by redistributing her appliances and adopting an open shelving design. With fewer tall, imposing cabinets and extended countertop space, Kristin's revamped kitchen is a lesson in less-is-more design.

<br><h3>While a significant expense for most homeowners, renovating your kitchen is also an investment that can last you for years to come and may even increase the overall value of your home. Therefore, there are a few tips you'll want to keep in mind before you embark on your renovation journey—as well as a number of common mistakes you'll want to try and avoid. Doing so will help make your time, effort, and money well worth it.

<br><u>The kitchen is probably the most used room in your house, so you want it to be a space you enjoy spending time in.

So whether you're renovating or simply looking for some inspiration, we found 85 kitchen ideas that will help you optimize your own—and the best lessons to take from them. From country casual to sleek and modern—and literally everything in between–we've got all the kitchen remodel inspiration you could ever need. Gorgeous countertops, unique backsplashes, and statement lighting, we're coming for you.

<br><u>Major remodels involve a larger overhaul of the existing kitchen than minor remodels. Key fixtures—lighting, appliances and flooring—are replaced with new versions, while extra touches are added such as a high-end sink with matching faucet and semi-custom cabinetry. Semi-custom cabinets are customizable, with versatile sizing and door front options.
</u>
<br><b>If a total kitchen transformation is what you’re after, it’s time to redo your flooring. Many choices are available nowadays. And if you’re looking for a durable, easy-to-clean option and love the traditional appeal of hardwood, consider a wood-look alternative such as vinyl or this glazed ceramic tile, which you can also use on the wall as a rustic backsplash.
